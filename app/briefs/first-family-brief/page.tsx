        <h2>What’s happening</h2>

        <p>
          Around the world, families are facing growing uncertainty, from rising
          living costs and regional conflicts to changing work conditions and
          increased stress on households.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many parents are feeling overwhelmed by constant updates, unclear
          information, and the pressure to protect their families without clear
          guidance.

      <section>
        <h2>Why this matters to families</h2>

        <p>
          When systems feel unstable, families carry the emotional and practical
          weight first.
        </p>

        <p>
          This affects daily routines, finances, children’s wellbeing, and
          long-term planning. Calm information and small, steady steps can make a
          meaningful difference.

        <h2>What you can do right now</h2>

        <p>• Keep one week of essential supplies if possible.</p>
        <p>• Have simple conversations with children, reassurance matters.</p>
        <p>• Review emergency contacts and local resources.</p>
        <p>• Limit news intake to trusted, calm sources.</p>
        <p>• Reach out to family or neighbors — community reduces stress.</p>
