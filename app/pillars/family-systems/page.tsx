        <p>
          Around the world, stable families share one quiet truth:
        </p>

        <p>
          They are not constantly returning for rescue.  
          They are not dependent on endless external intervention.
        </p>

        <p>
          They build systems that allow them to stand — even when conditions are hard.
        </p>

        <p>
          At JERIBW, we focus on systems because systems create:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Stability instead of survival mode</li>
          <li>Independence instead of long-term dependence</li>
          <li>Capacity to help others once steady</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>The 7 Founding Family Systems</h2>

        <p style={{ opacity: 0.75 }}>
          These systems are not cultural, religious, or income-based.  
          They appear consistently in stable families worldwide.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Communication System</h3>
        <p>
          Stable families do not communicate perfectly — they communicate predictably.
          Issues are addressed, repaired, and contained.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Time System</h3>
        <p>
          Time is protected intentionally.  
          Shared moments are prioritized over constant availability.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Financial System</h3>
        <p>
          Money is discussed openly.  
          Decisions are made based on needs, not pressure or appearance.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Conflict System</h3>
        <p>
          Conflict is managed, not avoided.  
          Disagreements are resolved without humiliation or fear.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Care & Well-Being System</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional and physical health are treated as maintenance, not emergencies.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Leadership System</h3>
        <p>
          Someone holds responsibility for direction.  
          Leadership is calm, accountable, and consistent.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Community System</h3>
        <p>
          Families stay connected — but not dependent.  
          Support is reciprocal, not draining.

        <h2>Why Systems Matter More Than Resources</h2>

        <p>
          Resources help in crisis.  
          Systems prevent repeated crisis.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal is not to create families who must always return for help —
          but families who grow stable enough to no longer need it.
        </p>

        <p>
          When families stabilize:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>They regain confidence</li>
          <li>They reduce external dependency</li>
          <li>They create space for new struggling families</li>
        </ul>
