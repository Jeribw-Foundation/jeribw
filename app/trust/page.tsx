      <p>
        We are building this platform for families — calmly, responsibly, and with care.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
      <p>
        Families everywhere are overwhelmed by noise, fear, misinformation, and delay.
        We exist to provide verified information and real-world resources in moments
        that matter most.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We prioritize verification over speed</li>
        <li>We partner with trusted NGOs and institutions</li>
        <li>We design for clarity, not panic</li>
        <li>We respect privacy and human dignity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
      <p>
        Our focus is families — across countries, cultures, and circumstances —
        especially those navigating crisis, uncertainty, or urgent need.
      </p>

      <p>
        This platform will continue to grow carefully, transparently, and in service
        of the public good.
      </p>
