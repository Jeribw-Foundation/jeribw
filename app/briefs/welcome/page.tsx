      <p>
        We built this platform because families everywhere deserve calm, verified
        information — not noise.

      <p>
        This is not breaking news. This is steady guidance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our mission is simple: help families understand what matters, access real
        resources, and move forward with clarity.
