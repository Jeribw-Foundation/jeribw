          If you are reading this, you may be feeling uncertain, overwhelmed, or

        <h2>What’s happening</h2>

        <p>
          Families across the world are navigating rising living costs, regional
          instability, changing work conditions, and growing pressure on daily
          life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many parents report feeling overloaded by constant news, unclear
          information, and the responsibility of protecting their households
          without reliable guidance.

      <section>
        <h2>Why this matters</h2>

        <p>
          When systems feel unstable, families carry the emotional and practical
          weight first.
        </p>

        <p>
          This affects routines, finances, children’s wellbeing, and long-term
          planning. Calm information and small, steady actions can reduce stress
          and restore a sense of control.
