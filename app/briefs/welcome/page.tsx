      <h1>Welcome to JERIBW — A Calm Starting Point for Families</h1>

      <p>
        If you are here, it likely means you are seeking clarity, stability, or
        support for yourself or your loved ones. You are not alone.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s happening</h2>
      <p>
        Families across the world are navigating rising costs, uncertainty,
        displacement, and information overload. Reliable guidance can be hard to
        find.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>
        When families lack clear information and trusted resources, stress
        increases and important decisions become harder to make.
      </p>

      <h2>What families can do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with the Resources section to find verified support.</li>
        <li>Visit Help if you need immediate guidance.</li>
        <li>Return regularly for calm Family Briefs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        JERIBW exists to provide clarity, dignity, and practical pathways forward.
